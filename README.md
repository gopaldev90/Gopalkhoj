# Gopalkhoj
Gopalkhoj(jumpnary search) is a search algorithm designed to efficiently locate an element in a sorted array by combining aspects of Jump Search and Binary Search. It aims to improve search performance in certain scenarios by leveraging the strengths of both algorithms.
# Overview
* Algorithm Type: Hybrid
* Time complexity:
** Best Case: O(√n)
** Average case: O(√n+log√n)
** Worst case: same as average case
* Space complexity: O(1)
# How it works
it has 2 phase
1. jump phase
2. Binary search phase


*jump phase:
1.The algorithm initially performs a jump search, which involves moving through the array in fixed-sized blocks. The block size is determined as √n
where 
n is the length of the array.
2. This phase quickly narrows down the potential location of the target element by skipping over large portions of the array.
* Binary Search Phase:
1. Once the block containing the target element is identified, a binary search is performed within that block.
2. This phase further refines the search by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, allowing for efficient locating of the target element.
* Advantages:
	Improved Efficiency:
		By combining the jump phase with binary search, Gopalkhoj can be more efficient than pure jump search, particularly in scenarios where the target is near the end of the array.
	Adaptive Performance:
		Offers potentially better performance compared to standard Jump Search while maintaining a constant space complexity.
*Use Case:
	Gopalkhoj is useful for searching in large, sorted arrays where a hybrid approach can provide practical performance benefits. It is particularly effective in scenarios where the data structure and access patterns align well with the algorithm's design.
Implementation:
	The algorithm is implemented in Python and can be used to search for elements in large, sorted lists. Below is an example implementation:
		# See the code
# How to Use:
	1.Add the gopalkhoj_search function to your project
	2. Call the function with a sorted array and the target element you wish to find.
	3. Retrieve the index of the target element if found, or -1 if not present.
